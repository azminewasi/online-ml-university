# ***Online ML University***: **AI & ML Resources from Top Universities**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves developing algorithms and models to enable computers to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to natural language in a meaningful way. NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks, including language understanding, sentiment analysis, machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and conversational agents. NLP techniques involve parsing sentences, extracting relevant information, analyzing grammatical structures, and building language models to process and generate text. For example, in chatbots or virtual assistants, NLP enables the system to understand user queries, extract intent and entities, and generate appropriate responses, providing natural and interactive conversations with users. NLP plays a vital role in various applications such as customer support, information retrieval, content generation, and automated language translation.
